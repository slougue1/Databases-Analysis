A  meta-analysis of research on experiments into the impact of social media use (for good or ill).

Can data help analys if this area of research has born fruit consistently enough to continue funding it?

What can usesr get from the R script:

The Alpha level used by the experimenters who conducted the study, which vary from study to study  (some use p-values of .10, others ,05, or .01), and whether the experimenters found a statistically significant result (Yes or No) at that alpha level. Considering just those experiments that used an alpha that equates to a p-value of .10, does the research appear fruitful?  That is, have enough experiments shown a significant result to believe that this social media use research is focused on a real phenomena, one with real impacts on mental health (for good or ill)? 
ANSWERS: Based on output of the scrit, Yes, the rate of successful experiments is better than what we would expect from chance

The numeric evidence (p-value) that was found which supported your finding?

Considering just those experiments that used an alpha that equates to a p-value of .05, does the research appear fruitful? 
ANSWERS: This group of experiments has not succeeded at a rate sufficiently higher than that which would be expected by chance to warrant further investigating according to NIMH standards for meta-analysis. However, the p-value approach statistical significance, and I would urge NIMH to see whether additional cases might be found to consider in a new meta-analysis.
