graphics.pptx are the output after making the changes bellow

demographics.R execute the following

1. Summarize all variables –
  1. for quantitative variables, that means minima, maxima, 1st and 3rd quartile limits, median, mean
  2. for categorical variables, that means counts of each category.
2. Calculate standard deviation, variance, and Skew of quantitative variables. (Remember that Skew isn’t in Base R, but is part of a package called, “moments”.)
3. Create a histogram of each quantitative variable.
4. Create a histogram of the log of “gold”.
5. Create a dotchart showing counts of categorical variables.
6. Create a barplot showing counts of categorical variables (this is duplicative of the dotchart from an analytic perspective, however, that will not always be the case, so it is useful to know how to create both types of charts).
7. Create a scatterplot matrix of the whole file.
8. Create an individual scatterplot of gold by intelligence (gold on the Y axis).
9. Create an individual scatterplot of gold by education (gold on the Y axis). Include a pair of reference lines – one vertical and one horizontal, each the median of the corresponding axis variable.
10. Create a new data file consisting of only the numeric variables (use the data.frame function).
11. Create a correlation matrix of all numeric variables on the file.
12. Derive the mean and median of ‘gold’ for each of the different races in the kingdom.
13. Derive the mean and median of ‘gold’ for those in each of the occupations in the kingdom.
14. Derive the mean and median of ‘gold’ for those with an education less than 3, 3 to 4.9, 5 to 6.9, and 7 or above.
15. Create a dotchart of gold by occupation.
16. Create a dotchart of gold by race.
17. Create a boxplot of gold by education.
18. Copy and paste all graphics – in order – into a powerpoint slide deck, one slide per question. (For example, #4 asks for one histogram per quantitative variable, so you put all the histograms for that question on the same slide.)  Include the question number as a text box added to each slide.  Your final deck for this section of the exam should include 10 slides.
