In a classic experiment (from the 1920s) into ESP (the proposed human capacity for psychically reading the minds of other people) a researcher had one person (the "sender") shuffle a deck of special picture cards, then pull them one at a time, stare at them, and attempt to project the image into the mind of a second person in the next room (the, "receiver").  The idea was that if a receiver could guess the picture more often than chance would suggest, then this would support the psychic hypothesis.  
And it apparently worked.  The researcher found a statistically significant effect.  These results were touted for the next twenty years as proof of ESP, despite other researchers being unable to replicate the results.  When others ran similar the experiments, the effect didn't appear.  They asked the original researcher to share more details of his procedures, along with his raw data for reanalysis.  He was happy to discuss his procedures, but refused to turn over his raw data, casting further suspicion on the finding.    
The data were hand-written columns of numbers -- he had used numbers to designate which card had been dealt during each trial. 
Data were recorded by hand, using numbers to indicate the picture card. 

1	Star
2	Circle
3	Square
4	Wavy lines
5	plus symbol
A match between the card and the guess by the receiver was coded as a 1
A mismatch (failure) was coded as a 0.

For example...

Draw   Success?

4                1

3                0

5                0

 

The above would indicate three trials -- Wavy lines, which the receiver successfully identified, square, which the receiver failed to identify, and a +, which the receiver also failed to identify.
